    <h1>Second Block (SB) <span><a href="../index.html">back</a></span></h1>
    <img class="demoimg" src="SB.png"></img>
    <p>RICK: Alright Morty, y-y-you got the first block, so now w-w-we gotta get
      a block just like that on the other side of the cube. I-i-it's got a really
      clever name, Morty, it's- *burp* it's really the m-most amazing name I've
      seen yet Morty. Y-y-you wanna know what it's called Morty?<br>
      MORTY: O-o-oh-ohhh is it called Jessica's boobs, Rick? I-i-i don't think
      I c-c-could conceive of a name more a-a-a-amazing than that! *swoon*<br>
      RICK: Y-yeah Morty, th-th-ankfully y-y-you probably won't conceive of a-anything
      else in your lifetime either *burp*. Nono Morty, it's-it's called the
      "second block", Morty! I-i-isn't that brilliant Morty? And o-o-oof all the
      possible names th-they could've chosen Morty! It's-it's-it's a stroke of
      genius Morty! Th-that one French guy that made this solving method
      re-*burp*-really knocked it out of the park with this one Morty!<br>
    </p>
    <a name="Square"></a>
    <h2>Square <span><a href="../index.html">back</a></span></h2>
    <img class="demoimg" src="Square.png"></img>
    <p>RICK: O-o-okay Morty, i-it's just like last time, w-w-we gotta build a
      square first. Th-there's a twist now though, since y-y-you don't wanna
      break your first block: y-you can only use the move set &lt;R,r,U,M&gt;
      to get the corner and edge into position.<br>
      MORTY: Oh-oh no Rick, th-the move sets a-are getting more and more
      restricted!<br>
      RICK: Y-y-yeah Morty, that's because you're solving more and more of the
      cube. E-e-eventually you'll only be able to turn &lt;M,U&gt;.<br>
      MORTY: O-o-oh wow Rick th-that's r-r-really restricted!<br>
      RICK: Y-y-yeah that's wh-what makes the m-m-ethod <b>fast</b>, Morty. I-it's
      called <b>ergonomics</b>; y-you got less things to turn, s-s-o it's easier
      to turn the things faster Morty!<br>
      MORTY: B-b-b-but Rick, isn't the square a lot harder to make now?<br>
      RICK: N-not if you know what you'e doing, Morty. *drink* Y-y-you first
      wanna solve th-the DR edge, like this:
      <img class="demoimg" src="DR.png"></img><br>
      Th-then y-you wanna use M slice pairing l-like the Meeseeks showed you
      for the first block t-to pair up th-the corner and edge that n-n-eed to be
      attached t-to the back of the DR edge to make the square--only this
      time, y-you can only use &lt;R,r,U,M&gt; to get the corner and edge into
      position. D-d-depending on where the pair got formed, *burp* here's how
      you want to insert it:<br>
      <table border=1>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Pair location</b></td>
          <td>UFL: <img class="demoimg" src="PairUFL.png"></img></td>
          <td>UFR: <img class="demoimg" src="PairUFR.png"></img></td>
          <td>UBL: <img class="demoimg" src="PairUBL.png"></img></td>
          <td>UBR: <img class="demoimg" src="PairUBR.png"></img></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Algorithm</b></td>
          <td>U2 r' U' r</td><td>U2 R' U R</td><td>R' U R</td><td>r' U' r</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br>
      MORTY: W-w-w-wait Rick, how come you a-a-already have the pair in the front
      attached to your DR edge in those diagrams?<br>
      RICK: I-i-i had to put those pieces somewhere Morty. I-i-i couldn't find a
      way to make them grey l-l-like the other pieces, s-s-so I figured it'd be
      better to h-have them already solved th-than cluttering up the rest of the
      cube, Morty. L-l-like I said, we're not k-*burp*-kings, Morty.<br>
      MORTY: O-ohoh okay Rick, s-so now d-do we solve those pieces?<br>
      RICK: Y-y-y-you guessed it, Morty. Y-y-you're really starting to get th-the
      hang of this whole "using your brain" th-thing Morty. I-i-if I'm honest I
      never thought y-you'd get this far Morty *drink* y-y-y-you should be real
      proud of yourself Morty.<br>
      <a name="Pair"></a>
      <h2>Pair <span><a href="../index.html">back</a></span></h2>
      <img class="demoimg" src="Pair.png"></img><br>
      <br>
      RICK: Wh-what we gotta do now is u-use M slice pairing to p-pair up the remaining
      two pieces that you need to complete Jessica's boobs, Morty! Once you h-have
      the pair Morty, h-here's how you wanna insert it depending on where it is:
      <table border=1>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Pair location</b></td>
          <td>UFL: <img class="demoimg" src="PairUFL_front.png"></img></td>
          <td>UFR: <img class="demoimg" src="PairUFR_front.png"></img></td>
          <td>UBL: <img class="demoimg" src="PairUBL_front.png"></img></td>
          <td>UBR: <img class="demoimg" src="PairUBR_front.png"></img></td>
          <td>Jessica's chest: <img class="demoimg" src="Jessica_front.png"></img></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Algorithm</b></td>
          <td>R U' R</td><td>r U r'</td><td>U2 r U r'</td><td>U2 R U' R</td>
          <td>s t o p &nbsp;b e i n g &nbsp;a &nbsp;w u s s
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>MORTY: H-h-hey, that's not funny Rick!<br>
      RICK: *drink* y-y-yeah yeah Morty, m-m-maybe you should grow a pair of
      y-your own a-a-and do something about it.<br>
      MORTY: Y-y-y-you know what Rick, you're right. I-i-im done with y-y-you
      and y-y-uour-<b>*pew*</b><br>
      RICK: *retracts stun gun* Well that about wraps up the second block!
      Th-that's all we got for now! I-i-i-it's over, see you on the
