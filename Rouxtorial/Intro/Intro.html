    <h1>Introduction <span><a href="../index.html">back</a></span></h1>
    <p>RICK: A-a-a-a-alright Morty, lemme e-explain some things, l-lay out
      so-some ground rules s-so y-y-ou don't go all messing things up w-when
      you t-try and solve the cube, Morty! Y-yy-y-y-you know how that cube is,
      one second you're just t-t-urning it all h-h-happy like a-a-a-and then
      before you know it i-i-it's got colors all over the place! We don't want
      that, Morty! *burp* W-w-w-we want all the colors t-to be on the right
      sides, Morty, but before we do that we gotta lay out some ground rules,
      Morty!<br>
      MORTY: O-o-oh jeez Rick, th-that sounds complicated!<br>
      RICK: Wwell Morty i-i-if you wanna leave y-y-ou can go at any time, j-just
      click on that b-b-b-back button next to any of the headings o-on this page
      a-a-and it'll take you back to the main page Morty!

    <p>RICK: O-o-okay Morty, first things first. See that i-i-iimage up there?
      That's what th-th-the demo pictures will look like, Morty! See right now
      i-i-it's solved, Morty! Do you see it?<br>
      MORTY: O-o-oh-oh-oh wow Rick, th-that's really s- <br>
      RICK: I-i-it's a work of art Morty! Just l-l-look at the perpendicularity
      of its sides, Morty! The equality of its measures! Th-they might've taken
      Pirates of the Pancreas from me b-b-b-but th-they'll never take my cube,
      Morty!

    <h2>Notation <span><a href="../index.html">back</a></span></h2>
    <p>RICK: W-w-w-we gotta teach this fella h-how to read cube notation, Morty!<br>
      MORTY: O-o-oh-oh okay Rick, h-h-how do you want to do that?<br>
      RICK: W-w-well actually I was th-thinking, and- *burp* I rather spend a
        y-year playing J-j-jerry's stupid balloon game than explain n-n-notation
        to someone. *drink*<br>
      MORTY: B-b-b-b-but Rick, w-w-we gotta teach th-th-this person.. thing h-how
        t-t-to read cube notation!<br>
      RICK: Y-y-yeah yeah Morty, g-g-get me that box over there in the corner,
        th-the- one n-next to the quantum carburetor.<br>
      MORTY: O-o-oh-ohkay Rick, h-<br>
      RICK: Alright, this ou-*burp*-ghta do it *pushes button*<br>
      <b>*POOOF*</b><br>
      MEESEEKS: Hi, I'm Mr. Meeseeks, look at me!<br>
      RICK: Y-y-y-yeah yeah Mr. Meeseeks, can you explain cube notation to this
        fella here?<br>
      MEESEEKS: Ohhhhhhhhh, can dooooooo!<br>
      <br>
      MEESEEKS: Here's a handy dandy table showing the basic moves you can do
        and what their corresponding letters are in cube notation! As you can
        see, single letters usually correspond to single 90 degree clockwise
        <b>face turns</b>! You can also use these letters to refer to faces!
        If I say "U layer" or "U face", it refers to the face that would get
        turned clockwise if I were to do a "U turn"! And if I say UB edge, that
        refers to the edge piece with stickers on both the U and B faces!
        (there's only one edge that that can be!) And if I say UFR corner,
        that refers to the corner piece with stickers on the U, F, and R faces!
        This lets us <b>uniquely identify</b> pieces on the cube! I'm Mr. Meeseeks,
        look at me!
      <table border=1>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Here's the letter in cube notation...</b></td>
          <td>U</td><td>L</td><td>F</td><td>R</td><td>B</td><td>D</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>And heeeeere's what the corresponding move looks like!</b></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="U.png"></img></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="L.png"></img></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="F.png"></img></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="R.png"></img></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="B.png"></img></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="D.png"></img></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br>
      MEESEEKS: If you make these letters lowercase, you get <b>wide moves</b>,
        which turn two layers at the same time! Sometimes you'll also see these
        moves denoted Uw, Lw, Fw, etc, where the <b>w</b> stands for <b>wide</b>!
      <table border=1>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Here's the letter in cube notation...</b></td>
          <td>u or Uw</td><td>l or Lw</td><td>f or Fw</td>
          <td>r or Rw</td><td>b or Bw</td><td>d or Dw</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>And heeeeere's what the corresponding move looks like!</b></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="Uw.png"></img></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="Lw.png"></img></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="Fw.png"></img></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="Rw.png"></img></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="Bw.png"></img></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="Dw.png"></img></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br>
      MEESEEKS: Now let's move on to some more advanced moves! M, E, and S are
        called <b>slice turns</b>, and lowercase letters like x, y, and z
        represent <b>rotations</b>! I'm Mr. Meeseeks, look at me!
      <table border=1>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Here's the letter in cube notation...</b></td>
          <td>M</td><td>E</td><td>S</td><td>x</td><td>y</td><td>z</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>And heeeeere's what the corresponding move looks like!</b></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="M.png"></img></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="E.png"></img></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="S.png"></img></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="x.png"></img></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="y.png"></img></td>
          <td><img class="demoimg" src="z.png"></img></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br>
      MEESEEKS: Now there's just one more thing you need to know: you can add
        symbols after these letters to <b>modify</b> the moves they represent!
        If you had a ' (which is called a <b>prime</b>!), that means to do the
        reverse of whatever letter came before it, and if you add a 2 (which is
        called a <b>two</b>!), that means to do the letter that came before it
        <b>twice</b>!<br>
      RICK: Jeez, Morty, d-d-do you think I should've t-t-oned down the
        patronizing l-l-levels when I made that box?<br>
      MORTY: I-i-i-i-iI don't know Rick, i-it's your box, d-don't ask me!<br>
      MEESEEKS: So that means if you see something like R', it means to turn
        the face represented by R counter clockwise! And if you see something
        like R2, that means to turn the face represented by R twice 90 degrees
        clockwise, which is the same as turning the face 180 degrees!<br>
      MEESEEKS: Ooookay, that should just about wrap it up! I'm Mr. Meeseeks,
        look at meeeee! *pooof*

    <p>RICK: O-o-okay Morty, now that m-m-my eardrums are working again, why
      don't you define a couple of terms for this fella s-s-so we don't have to
      explain them later. *drinks*<br>

          white would be on the side and b-b-blue on the top, th-then you would

    RICK: Alright g-g-goood job, Morty, I-i-i was afraid y-you wouldn't have been
    able to pull through, e-e-specially at the end there about o-o-rientation and
    p-p-p-p*buuuurp*ermutation. L-l-let's get this fella onto the
