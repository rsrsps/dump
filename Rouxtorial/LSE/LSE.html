    <p>RICK: S-s-so I have a-a bit of a confession to make, Morty. Th-this group isn't
      everything it's hyped up to be, Morty. Y-y-you'll struggle at first, Morty,
      but you gotta <b>persevere</b>, okay Morty? Y-you gotta persevere a-aand
      eventually it'll be good Morty, i-i-it'll feel real nice, Morty. k-k-inda
      l-like putting cubes w-w-way up inside your butthole, Morty. A-a-at first
      it was a little d-d-difficult a-a-and mildly painful, b-b-but now everything
      goes realy sm-smoothly, Morty. Th-that's what LSE is gonna be like, Morty!
      Y-y-you just gotta keep going, no matter how much it hurts, Morty!
      Y-y-you gotta do it for grandpa, Morty!<br>

    <h2>Orientation <span><a href="../index.html">back</a></span></h2>
    <p>
      RICK: A-a-alright first y-you gotta orient all the edges Morty. S-since
      y-your blocks have yellow on the bottom, e-e-edges are oriented if the
      w-white or yellow sticker is on the U or D face--if they're not on the U
      or D face, th-then they're bad Morty! Then we g-*burp*-otta fix them Morty!<Br>
      MORTY: Th-that sounds really complicated, Rick! H-h-how are we gonna fix
      th-the bad edges?<br>
      RICK: W-w-w-we're gonna use nothing but &lt;M,U&gt; moves, Morty! I-i-it
      works like this: w-w-we wanna m-move our bad edges around until they look
      like this, Morty!<br>
      <img class="demoimg" src="Arrow.png"></img><br>
      RICK: S-s-s-see how there are three bad edges on the U face, a-a-and one
      bad edge right below the three on the D face Morty? Th-this is want we
      want Morty, i-i-it's called the arrow case!<br>
      MORTY: W-w-wait how do we know that the edge in the back th-th-that we
      can't see (DB) is good? C-c-couldn't we have five bad edges?<br>
      RICK: N-n-nah Morty that's impossible, th-the cube can only have an even
      number of bad edges at any g-i-i*burp*iven time Morty. S-s-so we know by
      deduction that DB can't be bad, b-b-because then there'd be an odd number
      of edges.<br>
      MORTY: O-oo-oh th-that's pretty neat Rick! Th-that's really nifty! I-i-it
      would really come in handy if y-y-you wanted to solve q-quickly, yknow?
      B-b-because you could figure out wh-which edges are bad j-j-just by looking
      at the edges that are already visible!<br>
      RICK: Th-that's exactly right Morty, y-y-you're starting to catch on. I-i-i
      may have to g-g-go back to the council of R-r-ricks and g-g-get myself a-a-a
      more effective Morty if y-y-you keep using your brain that well like that
      Morty!<br>
      N-n-now the arrow case is good because once you have it, y-y-you do this
      thing called the <b>Moo</b>, Morty, a-a-a-and it orients all your edges!
      Th-the Moo goes like this Morty: <b>M' U M'</b><br>
      Y-y-you can also do a variant of the Moo from the back, Morty! I-i-it
      looks like this: <b> M U M'</b><br>
      Th-that'll solve an arrow th-that's facing the opposite direction, like
      this (once again Morty, y-y-you know DB is bad because you see a-an odd
      number of edges, wh-which means the hidden edge must also be bad, Morty):<br>
      <img class="demoimg" src="BackArrow.png"></img><br>
      MORTY: Oh-oh wow, th-that's r-really neat Rick, b-b-b-but what about wh-when
      you don't have an arrow, Rick? Wh-what if there are only 2 bad edges,
      or what if a-a-all 6 edges are bad?<br>
      RICK: W-w-well then y-y-you gotta g-g-get them to the arrow case, Morty!<br>
      L-look Morty, I've made a nice table here t-to explain it to you. H-h-here's
      how you s-solve all the orientation cases Morty! P-p-pick the entry that
      describes w-w-where your bad edges are on the cube a-a-and follow the
      instructions below it, Morty! E-e-e-each instruction set w-w-will get you
      to a different entry on the table, Morty! J-j-just keep l-l-looking up the
      case and following the corresponding instruction u-u-until you reach the
      fully oriented state, Morty!<br>
      MORTY: W-w-wait what about all the other colors on the diagram, Rick?
      I-i-i-i thought we were just l-l-looking at white and yellow stickers!<br>
      RICK: Yeah Morty i-i-its' like I said, w-w-we can't afford fancy diagrams
      a-a-nd all that *burp*. J-j-just ignore the other colors Morty! I-i-it's
      like what you do with your insecurities o-o-on a daily basis! Jj-just
      pretend they aren't there Morty!

    <h2>UL and UR <span><a href="../index.html">back</a></span></h2>
    <p>
      RICK: A-alright Morty, now that your edges are oriented, w-w-we need to
      solve the UL and UR edges. S-s-since your blocks have red on the left
      a-a-and orange on the right, w-w-we need to solve th-the white-orange
      and white-red edges in this step. A-a-a-after this Morty w-we're not even
      in &lt;M,U&gt;-land, Morty! W-w-we'll be in th-the &lt;M,U2&gt; group,
      w-w-which is even smaller! Th-th-that's how close we are
      to solving the cube, Morty!<br>
      MORTY: O-o-oh-oh wow, Rick, th-th-that's a-a-a very restricted move group
      w-w-we got there! W-we're really reducing th-th-the cube down to very few
      states, Rick!<br>
      RICK: *buuuuuurp* th-that's how it works Morty. Cube'll-l be solved w-within
      the hour, Morty, y-y-you just watch.<br>
      MORTY: S-s-so how do you solve UL and UR, Rick?<br>
      RICK: I-i-it works the saa-a-a*burp*- the same way Morty. Y-y-you look for
      your UL and UR edges in the table below and f-f-follow the instructions
      to get t-to a state closer to solved. T-t-then you l-l-look up your new
      state in the table a-a-and repeat until it's solved Morty! I-i-iit's that
      simple Morty! Soon y-y-you won't even need the table to solve this stuff
      Morty, then th-these steps'll really fly, you'll see! J-j-just gotta
      persevere, Morty!<br>
      N-n-n-now first we gotta p-p-put the edges in a position w-where we can
      solve them easily Morty! To do that, y-y-you gotta keep following the
      table Morty! Note that s-s-some of the pictures are tilted t-to give you
      a view of the B face--d-don't accidentally rotate your cube Morty!
      W-w-w-we probably should've told this fella here this o-on the first page,
      b-b-but you don't ever rotate your cube w-w-when solving using the Roux
      method Morty! N-n-not even once, i-i-it's like what you m-m-millenials
      say a-a-about drugs these days!
      Also note that w-w-we don't care about which one is in which place
      right now, j-j-just that they occupy the two positions--so i-i-if you have
      your UL and UR matching the picture, b-b-but swapped in position, don't
      worry about it. *drink*<br>

    RICK: O-okay Morty, w-w-we are now ready t-to get our UL and UR edges solved!<br>
    MORTY: O-o-oh boy Rick, h-h-how are we gonna manage that?<br>
    RICK: W-w-well Morty, do y-you see those c-co-*burp*-olors on the sides
    of your corner pieces? S-s-see how, on a-aany given face, th-they are always
    th-the same color?<br>
    <img class="demoimg" src="Slots.png"></img><br>
    MORTY: O-o-oh yeah I-i-i see it Rick. L-l-like in the picture above, th-the
    stickers on the F face o-of the U layer corner pieces are all red, a-a-and
    the stickers on the R face of the U layer corner pieces are all blue, a-a-and
    th-the pattern continues for the other sides!<br>
    RICK: Y-y-yeah Morty, exactly. S-s-see how between each pair of identical colors,
    th-there's an empty space wh-where an edge piece should go? L-l-like in that picture,
    th-theres a space on UF b-b-between the two red stickers on the F face?<br>
    MORTY: Y-y-yeah Rick, i-i-is that how we're gonna solve the UL and UR edges?<br>
    RICK: Yuuu-*burp*-uup. W-w-we're gonna call those things slots. S-s-so in
    that p-picture up there, th-the front face c-currently contains the "red slot",
    th-the right face contains the blue slot, a-a-a-and so on.<br>
    MORTY: O-o-o-okay Rick, b-b-b-but how does this help s-<br>
    RICK: Y-y-y-yeah I-ii-i-i'm getting there, Morty! Y-y-y-you gotta be patient,
    y-you know? G-g-good things c-come to those who wait, a-a-and all that.<br>
    N-n-now remember: y-y-our UL and UR pieces are in the D layer. Wh-what you want
    to do is <b>adjust the U face</b> u-until the color of the slot on the front
    face i-i-is "opposite" o-o-of the color of the sticker on FD! S-s-so in that
    p-p-picture, s-s-since FD is red, y-y-you want to get the orange slot above
    it, since the red is opposite orange on the cube!<br>
    Th-then, after y-you have the correct slot lined up, y-y-you want to do an
    <b>M2</b>, a-a-and y-y-you'll have put your UL and UR edges i-into the slot
    Morty! N-n-now you just- you just gotta adjust y-your U face until y-y-you
    have two c-c-completely solved layers on the left and right faces Morty!
    I-i-it'll look something like this demo picture in the section below Morty!<br>

      RICK: O-o-okay Morty, n-now here a-a-re the harder ones. Th-they're hard
      because th-they'res no super easy pattern. H-h-here are some examples:<br>
      <img class="demoimg" src="3cycle1.png"></img>
      <img class="demoimg" src="3cycle1.5.png"></img>
      <img class="demoimg" src="3cycle2.png"></img>

      <img class="demoimg" src="3cycle4.png"></img>
      <img class="demoimg" src="3cycle5.png"></img><br>
      MORTY: W-w-w-wait Rick, th-those last two l-l-ooked almost exactly the same!<br>
      RICK: Yup *drink*. These cases a-are a bitch to recognize, Morty. Th-they're called
      3-cycles, b-b-because you have to cycle 3 edges a-along the M slice to solve
      them.<br>
      MORTY: Oh-oh-oho-o-ohh jeez, Rick h-h-how do we figure out which a-a-algorithm
      to use?<br>
      RICK: Y-y-y-you use your <b>brain</b>, Morty. L-look, see the first o-one
      of those examples up there? S-s-see how i-it has a weird thing going on
      w-with the UF e-edge where that edge is connected to both of its adjacent
      centers?<br>
      MORTY: Y-yeah?<br>
      RICK: A-a-a-and see how th-the second one h-has a weird edge at UF a-a-all
      by its lonesome, not connected t-to any of its adjacent centers?<br>
      MORTY: Y-y-yeah, so what, Rick?<br>
      RICK: W-w-w-well i-i-if that v-v-at between your ears h-had anything going
      on in at all in there Morty, y-y-you'd realize that th-they're useful
      identifiers f-for 3-cycles Morty! Y-you see, every 3-cycle has o-one
      connected block and one lonely edge. T-to solve them, you want to adjust
      the M slice u-until the lonely edge is in the U face a-a-and the connected
      block is not in the U face.<br>
      For the first example up there, i-i-it'd look something like this Morty:<br>
      <img class="demoimg" src="adjustedMslice.png"></img><br>
      RICK: I-i-i've adjusted the M slice by 180 degrees a-a-and moved the camera angle Morty.
      Y-y-you can see that the connected block is in DB (y-y-you can see it in
      the reflection o-on the bottom there, Morty) a-a-and the lonly edge is in UB. *drink*<br>
      Turns out y-y-you can only get two possibilities once you a-adjust the
      M slice like this Morty: e-e-either the connected block and lonely edge
      are in the back, l-like in that picture up there, o-or they're in the front.
      I-i-if they're in the back, you gotta do <b>U2 M' U2</b>, a-a-a-and
      if they're in the front, you gotta do <b>U2 M U2</b>! I-i-i-it's that
      simple Morty! A-a-after that, y-y-you just gotta adjust the M slice until
      th-the cube is solved, Morty! Th-th-that's all there is to it Morty!<br>
