    <p>RICK: Okay Morty, y-you see that cube right there? Y-y-you see how it has
      some stuff th-that's all joined up on the left side, l-l-like a block?<br>
      MORTY: Y-y-yeah Rick?<br>
      RICK: Our first mission i-is to make one of those. I-i-it's a- *burp*
      it's a-a-a 2x3x1 block o-o-on the left side of the cube.<br>
      MORTY: W-w-w-wait what about the other colors on the cube Rick? D-d-do we
      have to solve those too?<br>
      RICK: N-n-no the other colors are there because I-i-i-i don't have th-the
      motivation t-t-to make a d-d-diagram just for this Morty. I-i-i just took
      the solved cube y-you saw on the introduction page a-a-and did some stuff
      to it. Th-this is the best w-w-we got Morty, y-y-you just gotta ignore
      the other colors Morty!  W-w-w-we aren't kings, Morty! W-w-we can't be just
      making up n-new cubes l-l-left and right Morty! We gotta w-w-work with the
      cards we were dealt, Morty!

    <p>RICK: O-o-okay Morty, you see that square right there? Th-that's what we
      gotta build first, Morty!<br>
      MORTY: H-h-h-how do we go about doing that, Rick?<br>
      RICK: I don't know, Morty! I-i-i-it's supposed to be an "intuitive step",
      Morty! Y-y-y-you gotta figure it out for yourself! I th-think the point
      of this puzzle i-i-is to challenge your brain, Morty!<br>
      MORTY: Awwwwww, man!<br>
      RICK: W-w-w-what Morty, y-y-you thought this would be super easy, do
      e-exactly as Grandpa Rick says? Y-y-you gotta think for yourself, Morty!
      Th-th-th-is isn't math class Morty, y-y-ou gotta use your <b>brain</b>!
      Just turn th-the thingies around a bit a-a-and see if you can
      ma-a-*burp*-ake the square on your own, Morty!

    <p>MORTY: O-o-oh-okay Rick, I got the square!<br>
      RICK: *wakes up* Wha- jeez Morty, what year is it? I-i-i didn't think y-you'd
      ever finish that square, with y-you going at it like that, a-a-all huffy
      and puffy! W-w-ell, now y-y-you gotta solve a pair Morty!<br>
      MORTY: Oh jeez Rick, a-a-a-a a pair?<br>
      RICK: Yeah Morty i-it's a 2x1x1 block th-that you need to connect t-to your
      square t-t-to make the rest of your first 2x3x1 block.<br>
      MORTY: O-o-oh-oh jeez Rick, I-i-i don't know if I can do that without
      breaking my square!<br>
      RICK: A-a-alright Morty I don't want y-your brain to explode now, s-so let
      me give you some tips. *burp* You don't want to b-b-reak your square, so
      y-y-you gotta restrict your m-m-moves to &lt;U,F,R,r,M&gt; (a-a-all this
      means is that you can o-only do moves that start with those letters, Morty.
      *drink* O-o-oobviously if you wanna do things l-like U', U2, r2, go ahead
      and kn-n-n-ock yourself out). Do that a-a-and
      you'll never break your square. I-i-i-if you still need help, *throws
      meeseeks box at wall*<br>
      <b>*POOOF*</b><br>
      MEESEEKS: Ohhhh hi there, I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!<br>
      RICK: Alrigh' Mr. Meeseeks, look a-after this fella here a-a-and *burp*
      and help him w-with making the p-pair for his first block. *drink*<br>
      MEESEEKS: Ohhhhhhhh, caaan dooooooooo!<br>
      <br>
      MEESEEKS: Okay, I'm going to teach you something called <b>M-slice pairing</b>!
      What you gotta do here is put the edge piece in a specific place, put
      the corner in the U layer, and then use an M turn to <b>pair</b> them together!<br>
      First, you want to <b>identify</b> the corner and edge that you gotta join
      together, and figure out where they are in the cube!<br>
      Theeeen, use the move set &lt;F,R,r,U,M&gt; to put the edge into the <b>DB</b>
      position!<br>
      Now, you wanna take your <b>corner</b>, and use the move set &lt;R,U,F&gt;
      to put the corner into the U layer without moving the edge piece you just
      placed! Be careful thouuugh--since the<b>bottom</b> color of your square
      is yellow, you want the yellow sticker on your corner piece to face
      <b>outwards</b>! That means you gotta make sure that the yellow sticker is
      on the <b>left or right</b> face, <b>not</b> on the front, back, or top/U face!<br>
      Okaay, now turn the M slice until the edge lines up with the corner! If
      all of the colors line up, you've successfully made a <b>pair</b>! If they
      <b>don't</b>, and the edge ends up being <b>oriented wrong</b>, as shown
      in the picture below, don't fret!<br>
      <img class="demoimg" src="BadPair.png"></img><br>
      MEESEEKS: Okay, so what you wanna do is <b>turn the M slice again</b> to
      put the edge back to DB where it was before--now, do a <b>U2</b> to move
      the corner, and theeeeeen turn the M slice again until it lines up with
      the corner! If you've followed these instructions correctly, you've now
      got yourself a nice 2x1x1 pair! All we have to do now is <b>attach</b> it
      to your square. Take a look at the table belooow, and apply the corresponding
      algorithm to solve your first 2x3x1 blooooock! I'm Mr. Meeseeks, look at me!<br>
      <table border=1>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Here's where the pair is on the U layer...</b></td>
          <td>UFL: <img class="demoimg" src="PairUFL.png"></img></td>
          <td>UFR: <img class="demoimg" src="PairUFR.png"></img></td>
          <td>UBL: <img class="demoimg" src="PairUBL.png"></img></td>
          <td>UBR: <img class="demoimg" src="PairUBR.png"></img></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>And heeeeere's the algorithm you need to solve it!</b></td>
          <td>F'</td><td>r' F</td><td>U2 r' F</td><td>U2 F'</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br>
      MEESEEKS: Okaaay, if you've gotten this far, then you've <b>successfully</b>
      completed your first 2x3x1 blooock! Click <a href="../SB/SB.html">heeeeere</a>
      to move on to the next step! If you need more heeelp, just scrolllll back up
      and try <b>redoing</b> the previous steps! I'm Mr. Meeseeks, look at me!<br>
      <b>*poooof*</b>
