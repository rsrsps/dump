    <p>RICK: O-o-okay Morty, we're almost there! Now w-we gotta solve the U layer
      corners, Morty! S-s-s-see how a-all the edges are a mess, b-but the corners
      are completely solved, Morty? Th-that's where we gotta get to, Morty! I-it's
      a good place to be, Morty! I-i-it even has a special name c-c-called the
      &lt;M,U&gt; group, Morty! *burp* O-o-once you're there Morty, y-y-you
      don't need to turn your wrists at all to solve the rest of the cube, Morty!<br>
      MORTY: O-o-o-oh wow, Rick, th-that sounds l-l-like it'd be advantageous i-if
      you wanted t-t-to solve the cube quickly, yknow? L-l-like if you wanted to
      time yourself a-a-and compete against others and everything!<br>
      RICK: Like I said Morty, i-i-iit's a great place to be. N-n-now let's get
      these corners solved s-s-so we can actually be there, Morty, i-i-instead
      of just fantasizing about being there, Morty! W-w-w-we don't wanna be like
      you and J-j-je-*burp*-essica's boobs, Morty!<br>

    <h2>Permutation <span><a href="../index.html">back</a></span></h2>
    <p>
      RICK: I-I-I don't really have a good demo picture for this one, Morty, s-so
      you're just gonna have t-to use your brain on this one. I hope th-that
      isn't too much to ask for.<br>
      MORTY: Y-y-you know what Rick, I've j-just about had it w-with y-y-you!
      I-i-i don't need your stupid 3d pictures t-to understand w-what you're saying,
      Rick!<br>
      RICK: *burp* Alright good, th-they were getting really boring to make
      anyway. W-w-we only need two or three here, tops.<br>
      So w-what you gotta do here is figure out which corners are "good" and
      which corners are "bad". Th-then we'll use an algorithm to permute the
      corners and make it so that they're all good.<br>
      MORTY: S-sounds good, Rick. H-h-how do we tell how a corner is good or
      bad?<br>
      RICK: Wow Morty I-i-i thought y-y-you'd never ask, Morty. Wh-what you do
      is y-y-you look at each corner a-a-and compare the sticker colors t-to
      the colors of the block you made before right below it. S-s-since
      the bottom of your block is yellow, th-the solved cube will be white on
      top, wh-which means w-w-we ignore the white stickers when comparing the
      corners to the edges. *drink* Here's an example:<br>
      <img class="demoimg" src="BadExample.png"></img><br>
      RICK: S-see how th-the non-white stickers, blue and red, aren't the
      same as th-the stickers of the edge piece below it (red and green)?<br>
      MORTY: O-oh wow Rick, yeah. S-so that corner is bad?<br>
      RICK: Yu-*burp*-up. H-h-here's an example of a good corner:<br>
      <img class="demoimg" src="GoodExample.png"></img><br>
      MORTY: O-o-oh wow Rick, th-the red a-a-and green stickers on the corner
      are th-the same as the red and green on the edge!<br>
      RICK: Yeah Morty, i-i-iit's brilliant. S-so now what you gotta do is check
      your corners and determine which ones are good and which ones are bad.
      *drink* I-i-if you have zero or one good corner(s), do a <b>U</b> a-and
      recheck them. K-k-keep doing that until you get at least two good corners.<br>
      F-f-from here, th-there are a couple of po-*burp*-ossibilities:<br>
      <table border=1>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Case</b></td>
          <td><b>Algorithm</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Two good corners adjacent to each other</td>
          <td>O-okay, t-turn the U face so that th-the 2 bad corners are both
              on the left (at UFL and UBL), then do this: R U' L' U R' U' L U.
              Th-the corners are now permuted r-r-relative to each other, s-so
              if you turn the U face enough times, y-y-you'll eventually see
              that all 4 corners are good.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Two good corners diagonally across from each other</td>
          <td>O-okay, do this: F (R U R' U')3 F'. Th-the 3 means to do
              everything before th-the 3 in parentheses three times. Again,
              th-this'll make all the corners correctly permuted relative to
              each other, which means that y-y-you'll eventually see 4 good
              corners if you turn the U face enough times.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Four good corners</td>
          <td>W-w-w-well what are you waiting for? Go on to the next step,
              y-y-you get to skip this step, no algorithms! Wubbalubbadubduuuub!</td>

    <p>
      RICK: O-o-okay Morty, n-now that the corners are permuted, w-w-we gotta
      orient them. S-s-see how all the corners have white stickers on the U face?
      Th-th-that's what we gotta get to Morty! Once w-w-we're there, we're in
      th-that great place we wanted to be Morty! W-w-w-we'll be in the &lt;M,U&gt;
      group Morty! W-w-we're that close to Jessica's metaphorical boobs, Morty!
      <br>
      A-a-a-all we gotta do is learn one algorithm, okay Morty?<br>
      MORTY: O-o-oh-ohhh I dd-d-on't know if I can learn another algorithm, Rick;
      w-w-w-we've learned so many already! I-i-i think we sh-should just give it
      a rest y-you know? Jus-<br>
      RICK: I-i-iit was a rhetorical question Morty, n-n-nobody actually cares
      about the fact that y-y-you're unwilling to work to achieve your dreams,
      Morty! Th-h-the algorithm you need to learn is called the Sune, Morty, i-it
      goes like this: R U R' U R U2 R'<br>
      N-n-now what you have to do is look at the pattern the white corner stickers make
      on your cube from above, Morty! Th-they will look like one of the patterns
      i-in the table below, Morty, a-a-and if they don't, j-just turn the U face
      until they do. *drink* Then just d-do what th-the table tells you to do and
      you'll be in pa-a-a-*buuurp*-aradise, Morty! Y-y-y-ou'll be in the
      promised land! Th-the fundamental structure of the universe w-w-will be
      laid bare before your eyes, Morty! (W-w-w-when it says things like
      Sune2, th-that means to do a Sune twice, Morthy! I-i-iit's pretty self
      explanatory, Morty!)

      RICK: A-a-a-lright M-m-orty, I-i-i'm gonna take a big leap of faith here
      and assume that you actually followed the i-instructions correctly. Y-y-you
      know what that means Morty? I-it means we're in paradise Morty! W-w-we're
      finally in the &lt;M,U&gt; group, Morty! F-f-from this point on our
      ergonomics are th-through the roof, Morty! I-i-it's all smooth sailing
      from here! It's time to move on to the
